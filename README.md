# Mushroom Classification

## Dataset Description:
-The dataset contains 8124 instances with 22 features, describing hypothetical samples of 23 gilled mushroom species. Each species is labeled as edible ('e') or poisonous ('p'), with some missing values present.

## Algorithms:

-Logistic Regression 
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest Classifier 
-Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
-Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Methods:

-Feature Encoding:
  One_Hot_Encoding & Label_Encoding 
-Feature Selection: 
  Experiment_01: Removing the Feature with the Highest Absolute Correlation & 
  Experiment_02: Selecting Only Features with Absolute Correlation > 0.5 
-Hyperparameter Tuning GridSearchCV 
-Feature Scaling

## Functions:

-Correlation Analysis 
-Train-Test Split 
-Model Evaluation 
-Overfitting Check
